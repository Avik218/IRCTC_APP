# IRCTC_APP

## Overview
IRCTC_APP is a Java-based ticket booking application designed to streamline the train ticketing process. The application provides an intuitive interface for managing train travel bookings and incorporates modern Java features such as the Stream API and lambda expressions for efficient and concise coding.

## Features
- **Sign Up:** Register a new account.
- **Login:** Securely authenticate with your credentials.
- **Fetch Bookings:** Retrieve all your current bookings.
- **Search Trains:** Find available trains based on your travel criteria.
- **Book a Seat:** Reserve a seat on a chosen train.
- **Cancel Booking:** Cancel an existing booking.
- **Exit the App:** Safely exit the application.

## Architecture

The application is built using a layered architecture that clearly separates concerns:

### Entity Layer
This layer contains the core data models and domain objects:
- **User:** Captures user details including username, encrypted password, and profile information.
- **Booking:** Represents ticket booking details such as booking ID, associated user, train details, seat number, and booking status.
- **Train:** Contains train-related data such as train number, name, available seats, schedule, and route.

These entity classes serve as the primary data holders and are serialized/deserialized to and from a local JSON database.

### Service Layer
The service layer encapsulates the business logic and interacts with both the presentation and entity layers:
- **User Management:** Handles user registration, authentication, and password security using JBCrypt.
- **Booking Management:** Manages operations for fetching, creating, and canceling bookings.
- **Train Management:** Processes train search queries and retrieves train information.
- **Data Handling:** Uses Javaâ€™s Stream API and lambda functions to efficiently manage and process data from the local JSON database.

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** Core programming language.
- **Stream API & Lambda Functions:** Employed for efficient data processing.
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for development.
- **Gradle:** Build automation tool for dependency management and project building.

## Database
- **Local DB (JSON File):** The application uses a JSON file to store and manage data locally.

## Tools
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** Primary IDE for development.
- **Gradle:** Tool for building and managing project dependencies.
